## P1. True or False

1. Aging is an effective solution to priority inversion.
2. Dual-mode operation is supported by the CPU to protect the OS from applications.
3. TLB works well because of spatial locality and temporal locality, where temporal locality , means accesses to the same page tend to be close in time.
4. Peterson's solution is an example of the spin-based locks.
5. TLB entries can be extended with ASID to avoid TLB flushes during context switch.
6. In Linux, kernel logic addresses are physical continuous; most kernel data structures, like page tables or per-process kernel stacks, are stored in kernel logic address.
7. Memory-mapped I/O does not need special I/O instructions to operate the I/O ports and registers.
8. SJF can be regarded as a dynamic priority scheduling where its priority is the next CPU burst time.
9. A priority scheduling algorithm must be preemptive.
10. Exit() is always invoked when the process terminates.
11. seL4 is a formally verified micro kernel.
